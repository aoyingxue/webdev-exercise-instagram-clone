# Instagram Clone

For this assignment, you will create a site that looks similar to Instagram.

Your design must use the images below. Do not base your design on the current version of Instagram!
You can use any tools we've learned in class, including Bootstrap or another CSS framework, as long as you fulfill the requirements for the assignment and it looks as similar to Instagram as possible. You may not copy code from Instagram's website. 

Your HTML code must validate without errors using the W3C's validator. You can find it at https://validator.w3.org/ (Links to an external site.).

Requirements:

Overall, your page should look as similar to the screenshots below as possible, and include the following main elements:
Header bar with logo, search box, and icons
Header does not need to do shrinking effect when you scroll
Search box should include background color change on "focus" but other changes do not need to be re-created
Font Awesome (Links to an external site.) has a library of 1,500 icons that you may use. Alternatively, small screenshots/photos can be used for individual icons/buttons onlyâ€”not for groups of multiple icons/buttons or entire sections of the site. 
Main content area
Must contain 2 image posts with captions, # of likes, comments, etc. 
Must contain "suggestions for you" section
Sidebar with profile info, stories, and footer links.
Make sure stories area has too much content to fit and scrolls
Your page should have responsive behavior like Instagram, where around tablet size the sidebar disappears and the main section is centered. This can be accomplished using Bootstrap or your own media queries. Your work will be graded using Chrome or Firefox device emulation in the Dev Tools. You can test there as well, you do not need to test on actual devices other than your laptop.
